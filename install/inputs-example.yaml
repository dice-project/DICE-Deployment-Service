# Address of the Cloudify Manager that the DICE Deployment Service should use

# Cloudify Manager security username. If your Cloudify Manager does not have
# any security set, use an arbitrary value.

# any security set, use an arbitrary value.

# Protocol that Cloudify Manager is using to communicate with clients
# (http or https).
cfy_manager_protocol: https

# Certificate that should be used to validate https connection to Cloudify
# Manager. Note that before you set the path here, you MUST copy the
# certificate into "install" folder. For example, if you copied certificate to
# "install/cfy.crt", set this input to "cfy.crt". Or if you copied the
# certificate to "install/ssh/certs/mycert.crt", this input should be set to
# "ssh/certs/mycert.crt".
#
# Why is this copying necessary? Server certificate must be bundled with
# blueprint and the only way to do this is to place it into "install"
# directory.
#
# If Cloudify Manager is accessed over http or certificate that is being used
# is trusted, you should set this to null.

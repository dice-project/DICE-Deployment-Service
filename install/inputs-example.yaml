# User's FCO credentials: the username (e-mail address) or the API key user
# ID.  The best practice is to create an API key user in the FCO, which is
# then delegated to the automation. The API key user must be a member of the
# Admin Group to be able to deploy and delete VMs. Obtain the API username ID
# by visiting the FCO web GUI console, switching to Users section in the
# navigation at the left side of the interface, clicking on your API Key User
# entry and referring to the API username field. The user id is the first part
# of the entry before the "/" delimiter.

# FCO customer ID.  For an API key user, this ID is in the part after the "/"
# delimiter of the API username field. For a regular user, obtain this ID by
# visiting th FCO console (the web GUI). In the Users tab, click on one of
# the groups. Then open the Information panel and find the Customer
# information in Related resources & UUIDs.

# Set the ID of the SSH key to be used by the agent to make the VM accessible.
# This is the UUID that can be found in the SSH keys section of the FCO web
# GUI console, where you can click on the SSH key designated for Cloudify to
# be able to connect to the VMs, then switch to the Information tab. The UUIDs
# are listed in the Related resources & UUIDs panel for the item Network.

# Set the ID of the VCD where the DICE Deployment Service VM will be deployed.
# This is the UUID that can be found in the VCDs section of the FCO web GUI

# Set the ID of the FCO network that the VM will connect to.  This is the UUID
# that can be found in the Networks section of the FCO web GUI console, where

cfy_manager_protocol: https

# Certificate that should be used to validate https connection to Cloudify
# Manager. Note that before you set the path here, you MUST copy the
# certificate into "install" folder. For example, if you copied certificate to
# "install/cfy.crt", set this input to "cfy.crt". Or if you copied the
# certificate to "install/ssh/certs/mycert.crt", this input should be set to
# "ssh/certs/mycert.crt".
#
# Why is this copying necessary? Server certificate must be bundled with
# blueprint and the only way to do this is to place it into "install"
# directory.
#
# If Cloudify Manager is accessed over http or certificate that is being used
# is trusted, you should set this to null.
